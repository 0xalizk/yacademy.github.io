# Fellowship Program

<br>

yAcademy fellowships are **not** introductory programs to software auditing. They are trial-by-fire programs where you will audit pre- or in-production codebases, and the stakes are very high. 

* You will be auditing alongside our resident and guest auditors. 

* You will be expected to participate and add value to the discussions. 

* You will be expected to be fluent at setting up test environments, and run toolings. 

* You are not required to have had experience in auditing or coding in the Web3 space, but you must be proficient in sotware engineering generally (hence, Web2 developers are welcome to apply)

If you think this program is advanced for you, fear not, you can still join after going through an introductory program such as [Secureum](https://secureum.xyz/). If you prefer to fly solo, you can bootstrap yourself and hunt for bounties on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/). Then, come back and apply, we would love to boost your progress to an advanced level. 

If you think you are a good fit for the program (yay!), please apply:
