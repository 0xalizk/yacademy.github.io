# Fellowship Program

<br>

yAcademy fellowships are **not** introductory programs to software auditing. They are trial-by-fire programs where you will audit pre- or in-production codebases, and the stakes are very high. 

* You will be auditing alongside our resident and guest auditors. 

* You will be expected to participate and add value to the discussions. 

* You will be expected to be fluent at setting up test environments, and run toolings. 

* You are not required to have had experience in auditing or coding in the Web3 space, but you must be **proficient in sotware engineering** generally (hence, Web2 developers are welcome to apply)


* The time commitment is **>=20 hours per week**.

If you think this program is advanced for you, fear not, you can still join after going through an introductory program such as [Secureum](https://secureum.xyz/). If you prefer to fly solo, you can bootstrap yourself and hunt for bounties on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/). Then, come back and apply, we would love to boost your progress to an advanced level. 

### How long is the program?

1 month, covering 2-4 codebases.

### What is a typical week in the fellowship program?

- The auditing sprint starts on Monday with an overview session delivered by one of our resident auditors, a guest auditor, or the codebase author. 
- During the week, async discussion take place between fellows, mentors, guest auditors, residents, and codebase devs. 
- Fellows work in groups during the week. Groups may meet during the week over calls.
- At the end of the week (or second week for larger codebases), fellows present their findings and receive feedback from our residents, mentors, and codebase authors.
- The auditing sprint ends with a retreat session where we invite a prominent guest for a lecture or AMA with the fellows.

### Do you reward outstanding fellows?

Yes. 

- Fellows are peer-appraised at the end of the fellowship and rewarded accordingly. 
- Top fellows will be invited to join the academy as resident auditors.
