yAcademy is a founding member of the [Ethereum Security Alliance](https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-kernel-security-track/) along with Gitcoin and Status, which aims to create and nurture a a community of Web3 security experts. The goal is scout for talents, provide introductory training, and attract top talent to continue building their career in the security space which has thus far suffered from acute shortage of talents.

The typical journey of an aspiring security specialist begins with going thru the Gitcoin's [KERNEL](http://kernel.community/en/) security track, participates in its multi-month curriculum, and subsequently potentially get invited to yAcademy's intensive internship program where they get to work on auditing of real smart contracts. There are other amazing initiatives with similar goals in the ecosystem, including [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/), [ReviewDAO](https://forum.dao.reviews/), and [Best Practices](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2195/best-practicers). There are ongoing efforts to establish consolidate efforts between all these organizations.
