yAcademy is a founding member of the [Ethereum Security Alliance](https://gitcoin.co/blog/announcing-the-kernel-security-track/). The Alliance aims to bootstrap and nurture a a community of Web3 security experts: scouting for talents, providing introductory training, and attracting and compensating top talent to continue building their career in the security space which has thus far suffered from acute shortage of talents.

The typical journey of an aspiring security specialist begins with going thru the Gitcoin's [KERNEL](http://kernel.community/en/) security track, participating in its multi-month curriculum. Top talent get invited to yAcademy's intensive internship program where they get to work on auditing of real smart contracts, interacting with auditors and core developers. Interns that excel are compensated and/or invited to stay in the academy permanently as auditors or educators. 

Interns may also be invited if they are active in other security communities and initiatives such as [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/), [ReviewDAO](https://forum.dao.reviews/), and [Best Practices](https://gitcoin.co/grants/2195/best-practicers). There are ongoing efforts to establish consolidate efforts between all these organizations.
