The fellowship is 3-4 months, and will includes theory sessions, code overview sessions,  retreat sessions with leading experts in the field, office hours with devs and/or our residents, and ad-hoc sessions self-organized by groups of fellows. There are usually also be some quizzes and puzzles throughout. 

The fellowship leads up to an ~~audit~~ security review report (eg [[1]](https://github.com/zBlock-1/RLN-audit-report) [[2]](https://github.com/zBlock-1/spartan-ecdsa-audit-report)) contributed to collaboratively by everyone involved: fellows, residents, and mentors. 

<!--Developments in ZK proving systems informs our choice of what theory and implementations we choose in our upcoming ZK auditing fellowships. -->

- The auditing sprint starts on Monday with an overview session delivered by one of our resident auditors, a guest auditor, or the codebase author.
- Async discussion take place between fellows, mentors, guest auditors, residents, and codebase devs.
- Fellows can work in groups during the week. Groups may have virtual meetings to check progress and help each other. 
- At the end of the sprint, fellows present their findings and receive feedback from our residents, mentors, and codebase authors.
- The auditing sprint ends with a retreat session where we invite a prominent guest for a lecture or AMA with the fellows.
- yAcademy residents take care of aggregating all findings into one coherent report shortly after the fellowship ends. -->
- Before applying, please make sure you have read and understood the [general structure and guidelines of our programs](/fellowships/).
- You can review our [pilot ZK auditing fellowship](/fellowships/zBlock1) to: 
    - Get a sense of what the fellowship is like and 
    - Level up your understanding of ZK tailored to give aspiring auditors the minimum viable theory to get to the code.
