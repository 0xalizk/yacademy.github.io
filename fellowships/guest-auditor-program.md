# Guest Auditor Program

<br>
Auditing is a lonely business, but it doesn't have to be that way. 

If you have a strong track record in the security space (previous group auditing experience, multiple podium finishes on code4rena or Sherlock, Immunefi bounties, or outstanding security research), we welcome you to be our guest for 1-2 weeks and audit alongside our usual residents.

You will be prepped and supported by our resident auditors and core staff. All you have to do is show up, review code, and engage with our residents and fellows for the duration of the engagement.

You will be given access to the codebase well in advance to familiarize yourself with it. Our auditing sprints are a mix of sync calls and async discussions. Our fellows work in groups, and you'll have access to their groups to participate and mentor, alongside our resident auditors who are always there as well.

**If you think you are a good fit for the program (yay!), please [contact us](mailto:hello@yacademy.dev?subject:guest-auditor-program).**
