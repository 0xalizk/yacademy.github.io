# Auditing Services

<br>

For smart contract audits, please use the contact form on the [yAudit website](https://yaudit.dev/).

For ZK audits, please reach out by email to **zk** AT **yacademy** DOT **dev**

When we have an upcoming block, we offer the option to audit with our Residents plus 20+ up-and-coming Fellows taking part in the yAcademy Fellowship training program. When there is no upcoming block, the audit can still take place with our expert resident auditors.

**See the [completed yAcademy audit reports](https://reports.yacademy.dev/) and the [completed yAudit reports](https://reports.yaudit.dev/)**, ZK audits [1](https://github.com/orgs/zBlock-1/repositories)[2](https://github.com/zBlock-2/audit-report)
