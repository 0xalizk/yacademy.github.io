# Auditing Services

<br>

**[Completed audit reports](https://reports.yacademy.dev/)**

We be auditing, always.

During our fellowship programs, your code would be audited by everyone: residents, guest auditors, and fellows. Everyone submits their findings. Our residents will then verifty and curate the findings, and send you a unified report. 

If we're not running a fellowship at the time you requested an audit, your codebase will be audited by our residents. As there are no fellows to mentor, your codebase will be their only focus.


**If you are interested in getting your codebase audited, please [contact us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16EXT_Jbluw9wJIXK8GDLUafXFoYAgdw4-5mDpcUVIfI/viewform?edit_requested=true).**
