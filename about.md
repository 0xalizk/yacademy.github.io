                <h2>We are tackling a (human) scalability problem</h2>
                
                <br>

                Ethereum is on a path towards a gloriously scalable future thanks to innovations such as interactive provers, ZK-Rollups, efficient commitment schemes, and data-availability sampling. These innovations are the fruits of years of uncompromising focus on a maximally decentralized, secure, and credibly neutral blockchain.

                <br><br>

                But there are bottlenecks that need scaling. 

                <br><br>

                There is an acute shortage of software auditing talent. Considering how much value is at stake in blockchain systems, solving this bottleneck is essential to getting these trust-minimized systems for broader adoption.

                <br><br>

                Our model takes a different approach to auditing. We are nimble, with minimal administrative overhead. We audit communally, in a collaborative environment between our residents/mentors/guest auditors on one side, and our fellows on another.

                <br> <br>

                <b>The scalability gain comes from the fact that an outstanding fellow is invited to stay on as a resident, thereby helping us scale the size and quality of the next batch of fellows</b>.

                <br><br>


                The motivations behind our model:

                <br><br>
                

            * Traditional ways of education and collaboration are obsolete.

<br><br>

              * Invitation-only is an efficiency measure, to make sure time and energy is not wasted hand-holding mentees. But anyone who shows interest and meets the basic minimal requirements should get an invitation.<br><br>

              * Merit-based: auditors that stick around and bring value are rewarded.<br><br>

                * Synchronous communication is inefficient. We do have 2-3 sync calls per week, but we carry out discussions asynchronously. <br><br>
                
                * Everyone is peer-appraised. We make heavy use of the excellent Coordinape tool. This is how we keep ourselves nimble and light-weight on the administrative side, leaving us to focus on what matters: auditing. <br><br>

                * Some structure in the collaboration between fellows and residents/mentors/guest auditors is needed to reduce time waste.<br><br>

                * No time is wasted authoring educational materials: this is a trial-by-fire type of situation, mentees learn by walking along the auditing process of <b>real pre- or in-production contracts</b>. <br><br>


                <h4><b>Apply as a fellow:</b></h4>

                    If you are a developer or a researcher who is very fluent in programming, you may qualify.

                <h4><b>Apply as a guest auditor:</b></h4>

                    If you are a bug bounty hunter with a track record, a security researcher, or a full-time auditor, you may qualify to join our Guest Auditor program.

                <h4><b>Apply as a yAcademy contributor:</b></h4>

                    None of yAcademy core contributors were "hired". They all jumped in and started contributing in one or more aspects: auditing, documentation, recruitment, or ops and comms.<br>

                If you are eager to contribute in one or more areas but don't know how to break in, <a href="/contact">reach out and tell us more about yourself</a>.<br><br>
