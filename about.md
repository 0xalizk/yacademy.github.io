                <h2>We are tackling a (human) scalability problem</h2>
                
                <br>

                Ethereum is on a path towards a gloriously scalable future thanks to innovations such as interactive provers, ZK-Rollups, efficient commitment schemes, and data-availability sampling. These innovations are the fruits of years of uncompromising focus on a maximally decentralized, secure, and creidbly netural blockchain.

                <br><br>

                But there are bottlenecks that need scaling. 

                <br><br>

                There is acute shortage of software auditing talent. Considering how much value at stake in blockchain systems, solving this bottleneck is essential to getting these trust-minimized systems to the a wider adoption.

                <br><br>

                Our model takes a different approach to auditing. We are nimble, with extremely minimal administrative overhead. We audit communally, in a collaborative environment between our residents/mentors/guest auditors on one side, and our fellows on another.

                <br> <br>

                <b>The scalability gain comes from the fact that an outstanding fellow is invited to stay on as a resident, thereby helping us scale the size and quality of the _next_ batch of fellows</b>.

                <br><br>


                The motivations behind our model:

                <br><br>
                

            * Traditional ways of education and collaboration are obsolete.

<br><br>

              * Invitation-only is an efficiency measure, to make sure time and energy is not wasted hand-holding mentees. But anyone who shows interest and meets the basic minimal requirements should get an invitation.<br><br>

              * Merit-based: auditors that stick around and bring value are rewarded.<br><br>

                * Synchronous communication is inefficient. We do have 2-3 sync calls per week, but we carry out discussions asynchronously. <br><br>
                
                * Everyone is peer-appraised. We make heavy use of the excellent Coordinape tool. This is how we keep ourselves nimble and light-weight on the administrative side, leaving us to focus on what matters: auditing. <br><br>

                * Some structure in the collaboration between fellows and residents/mentors/guest auditors is needed to reduce time waste.<br><br>

                * No time is wasted authoring educational materials: this is a trial-by-fire type of situation, mentees learn by walking along the auditing process of <b>real pre- or in-production contracts</b>. <br><br>

                    None of yAcademy core contributors was "hired". They all jumped in and started contributing in one or more aspects: auditing, documentation, recruitment, or ops and comms. <br>
