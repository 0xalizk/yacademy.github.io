                <h2>We are tackling a (human) scalability problem</h2>
                
                <br>

                Ethereum is on a solid path towards scalability thanks to innovations such as general-compute in zero-knowledge, interactive provers, efficient commitment schemes, and data-availability sampling. These innovations are the fruits of years of uncompromising focus on a maximally decentralized, secure, and credibly neutral blockchain.

                <br><br>

                But there are bottlenecks that need scaling, such as security.

                <br><br>

                There is an acute shortage of software auditing talent. Considering how much value at stake in blockchain systems, solving this bottleneck is essential to getting these trust-minimized systems ready for broader societal adoption.

                <br><br>

                With this bottleneck in mind, our model takes a different approach to auditing. We are nimble, with minimal admin overhead. We audit communally, in a collaborative environment between our residents/mentors/guest auditors on one side, and our fellows on another.

                <br> <br>

                <b>The scalability gain comes from the fact that a few outstanding fellows from each fellowship are invited to stay on as a resident, which then helps us scale the size and quality of the next batch of fellows, and the virteous cycle continues.</b>.

                The model is also attractive to projects looking for audit: more eyes on their code. Not only is the code audit by resdient and guest auditors as usual, but there are 20+ fellows joining. It is not unusual that some fellows outperform veteran auditors in the quantity and quality (severity and complexity) of bugs uncovered. 

                We have two [fellowship](https://yacademy.dev/fellowships/) tracks: [smart contracts](https://yacademy.dev/fellowships/smart-contract-fellowships/), and [zero-knowledge](https://yacademy.dev/fellowships/zk-fellowships/). The former is typically 5-6 weeks, while the latter is 3-4 months. 

                The smart contract fellowship gave birth to our smart-contract professional auditing arm: [yAudit](https://yaudit.dev). We accept audit request both within and outside of the fellowships. [Contact us](https://yaudit.dev/#contact) if you are looking for an audit. 

                We will be spinning out a zAudit arm of zAcademy 4Q24 focused on auditing zero-knowledge codebases.
