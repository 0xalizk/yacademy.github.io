## <strong>How it works</strong>

yAcademy internships are 1-month programs where invited interns get to work on auditing real smart contracts intended for production. They work alongside yAcademy's auditors with input from Yearn's core teams. The program also includes special events with leading security experts and behind-the-scene at war rooms and crisis response simulations. 

## <strong>Trial by fire</strong>

Interns are expected to hit the ground running and set their dev environments quickly. There is daily async communication with auditors and fellow interns, as well as regular sync calls to discuss progress and answer questions. 

## <strong>Compensation</strong>

An essential part of yAcademy's mandate is to scout for and generously compensate top security talent. Interns who do the assigned work, ask intelligent questions, and provide help to fellow interns **will be compensated**. Top intern talents may be extended offers to **join yAcademy permanently** at the appropriate capacity, potentially [owning a piece of it](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-53-yacademy-planting-the-seed-of-a-sustainably-secure-future-for-yearn-and-beyond/7929).

## <strong>How to join</strong>

yAcademy proactively invites promising security talent to the internship program. Examples of an intern is someone who: (a) stood out in the KERNEL security program (b) completed a security bounty (such as on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com) or [ReviewDAO](https://reviews.dao)), and/or (c) has contributed code to Web3 generally and is willing to do
